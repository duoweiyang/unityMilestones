	•	Added my name to HUD on the top-right corner
	•	Changed script in PlayerController.cs. If 4 - 7 cubes are 	collected, the ball will turn cyan. 8 - 11, ball will turn blue. At 12 	(max), ball will be black. Went through documentation at: https://	docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Color.html
	•	Added obstacles (green flat and long cubes) to make game a 	little more challenging.
	•	Open Yang_D_m0 in the build folder to play the game
	•	Use arrow keys to move ball around and collect all cubes
	•	The only scene used in this assignment is called “miniGame”
