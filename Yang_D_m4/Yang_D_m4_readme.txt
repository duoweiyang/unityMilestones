- AI controlled Minion visits 5 stationary waypoints (that are visible). They are all red.
- AI controlled Minion heads off moving waypoint (that is visible). It is yellow.
- AI is controlled by procedural state machine of at least 2 states. In the code, the states are called moving (when traversing through static waypoints) and chasing (going to the moving waypoint).
- Minion is animated with steps/hops and is not sunk into the ground. Squeaky audio is also present.
- Fixed camera is looking down on scene instead of the chase cam. 
- Name on HUD is my name

Instructions:
- Open demo.unity for the scene.
- You should see the AI_Minion hop by itself through the waypoints again and again.
