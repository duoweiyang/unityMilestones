# unityMilestones
Work done for CS 4455 (video game design class) at Georgia Tech. These are weekly or biweekly assignments done in Unity. These were done to prep us for the final group project and introduce us to Unity mechanics. All assignments were done in Unity Version 2019.4.8f1 LTS and for 3D games.
